# COSC-310-Assignment2
## A brief description of our project: <br>
Our project is a simple and friendly chat-bot with which the user can talk about their hobbies, interests etc.  We are using the chat bot as a friend but in most cases these days these bots are used for customer service. Keeping in mind the recent pandemic and how it has changed everyone’s social lives. A virtual “friend” is able to make normal conversations and allows the user to chat to this bot anytime and share their experiences when their friends are busy or for the people who have a hard time socialising.
<br>
We have used the Java GUI to create an interface for the chat bot and used Java as the programming language that is used to develop this chat bot.

 ## Chosen SDLC: Waterfall Model
 
The software development cycle that we decided to work on is the waterfall model as for small deliverable projects waterfall model is convenient. As we are developing a small chat-bot whose requirements are clear, the project is short and simple, waterfall model seemed like a good fit for this project. This model is also very easy to understand as the steps are straightforward and avoids any confusion as it takes a more linear approach to the completion of the project.<br>
On the other hand, this model does slow down the process as the team needs to complete a step before moving on to the next one which often overlooks revision or any unexpected errors.

**WATER-FALL MODEL:**
1. PLANNING:
   -	Requirements
   - Project scope.
2.	DESIGN:
    -	User-friendly design
    -	User approval
    - Revision
3.	IMPLEMENTATION:
    - Developing phase
    -	Error-Handling
4. DEPLOYMENT:
5. MAINTAINENECE

## Assignment 3 Updates:
1. Added a better GUI for the user to feel like the individual is having a normal conversation with the bot. (**Figure 1**)
2. Added another topic of discussion regarding the topic, our bot was a freindly bot which would suggest some plans for the weekned, we added arcade to the list. This would allow the conversation to be more immersive.(**Figure 2**)  
4. Before there were 3 responses given if the user entered something out of topic, now there are five responses that the bot can provide the user with. The responses before were more repetitive and now as there are more responses that the bot could give, so the uder feels like it is a more normal conversation rather than talking to a bot.(**Figure 3**)
5. On entering “Clear screen” our Code clears the conversation and sets the screen empty 
6. If the user input is not understood by the Code, our code opens google search to look up for solutions.

## Data Flow Diagrams

We have also added two data flow diagrams for this project.
